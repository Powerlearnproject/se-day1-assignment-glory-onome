Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the structured and methodical planning,creation and evolution of software systems as well as their operations.
Its importance are as follows;
It enables the functional suitability of a software system
It ensures high performance efficiency of a software system
It provides maintainability for software systems.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Creation of more expressive programming languages
Integrating artificial intelligence in software
Expansion of transmission capacities.




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning phase- this includes activities conducted before the start of a software project.
Development phase - includes activities between the start of the project and the deployment of the finished system.
Operation phase - includes activities during the start up and operation of the system in the target environment
Maintenance phase - includes the upkeep and evolution of the system after deployment
Shutdown phase - includes activities used to take the system out of operation.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall model is the step by step processing of individual phases of requirements, analysis, design in a defined sequence.
It is appropriate for creating software process models for industrial information systems

Agile development is a process that involves the basic creation of software systems in several repetitive cycles called sprints.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A project manager role is to;
Coordinate quality assurance measures
Defining  a system quality
Observing and ensuring user satisfaction

A software developer role is to ; 
Program individual units of the system
Document generated program code
Integrate individual units into an overall system

A quality assurance engineer role is
Monitoring the project plan and productivity
Planning, organizing and estimating the cost of the project



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code.
Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg GitHub



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Unclear and changing requirements.
Technological evolution
Conflicting goals between time,cost and budget
Degenerated systems
Misunderstanding between team members 



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing - involves the testing of individual software components to check for compliance with specified requirements.
Integration testing - this test is used to check the interaction of groups of components to evaluate if they work together as described in the specification.
System testing- this is conducted after the system has been completed to check if it meets the specified requirements and specified quality properties.
Acceptance testing- this is the test conducted after the system has been installed under actual operating conditions .




#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing text prompts or inputs to elicit specific, desired responses from artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as language models or chatbots.

Importance of Prompt Engineering:
Improved Accuracy
Increased Efficiency
Enhanced User Experience
Better Decision-Making




Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

example of a vague prompt:
"Write a story about artificial intelligence."

This prompt is vague because:

  It lacks specificity
  the goals are unclear 
  Ambiguity

example of an improved prompt:
Write a 1000 word essay about the Chernobyl incident in Russia and its effect on residents 

The improved prompt is more effective because:

it is specific
the goals are clear 
it is concise
